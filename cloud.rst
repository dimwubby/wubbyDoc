*****************************
The wubby Cloud
*****************************

The wubby cloud provides a full overview and control of all the wubby enabled devices. Lets see how:

 - Every new wubby enabled product is registered in the wubby Cloud and is assigned a default application.
 - Using the wubby VM (see the :ref:`tutorial`) any *developer* [#f1]_ can create several applications compatible with one or more wubby enabled products. The developer can upload those applications in the wubby Cloud so that they are available to be aquired by other owners of wubby devices. 
 - Any owner of a wubby device (*customer*) can register himself and his devices in the wubby Cloud and select one of the compatible applications to be installed on his device.
